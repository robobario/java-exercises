# Static Members

A class can have static fields and methods. You could think of the static fields as `global`, all instances of the class can access and potentially change the value referenced by the field.

# Task

Update `Jar` so that the `random` variable is `static` (you need to add a `static` modifier to it's keywords). This means that in the test two instances of `Jar` will have the same `random`.
