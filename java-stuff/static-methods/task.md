# Static Methods

A class can also have static methods. You do not need an instance of the class to call static methods.

Static methods can access the other static members of the class (like fields and other members), but cannot access the non-static members.

But going the other direction, non-static methods are free to use static and non-static members.

# Task

Update `NumberSack` so that it adds together the two numbers. You will have to change a variable to static.
