# Collection manipulation

Some common operations you will come across are things like:

* concatenating collections
* finding elements in collection X that are also in Y
* removing elements
* accessing elements by index (when working with Lists)

## Task

Implement `concat()`. Returning a new list containing the elements from list1 followed by the elements from list2.
